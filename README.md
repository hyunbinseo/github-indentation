You can change how GitHub renders the tab.

GitHub / Settings / [Appearance] / Tab Size Preference

[Appearance]: https://github.com/settings/appearance

However, it does not apply to [markdown codeblocks].

```jsonc
{
	// Indented with a tab. How do I look?
	"key": "value"
}
```

As of 2023-11-17, it is rendered at a fixed 4 space.

You can compare this to [sample.jsonc](sample.jsonc)
